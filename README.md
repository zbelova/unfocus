# Unfocus
Focus timer that requires moving or dancing while you take a break and unfocus. Your phone starts to play music when the unfocus time comes.  

This application helps to avoid excessive strain when focusing too much on one activity. It is especially useful for individuals with ADHD who tend to hyperfocus. The app plays music and tracks movement during the focus break. Once you have moved for a sufficient amount of time, you can turn off the music and relax. The app can be customized: you can choose the music, whether the phone should vibrate and send notifications, and more. It is also possible to disable the requirement for movement during the break.
